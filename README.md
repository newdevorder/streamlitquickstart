## Motivation: Build deployable and testable apps as soon as possible with as few lines of code as possible.

## Problem: It takes a lot of code and a lot of steps to write, test, and deploy an app. Javascript Typescript and all of these other technologies are great but they can be burdensome when testing data-driven applications like chatbots and heavy data-driven originally python-based applications.
